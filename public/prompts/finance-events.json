It classified all Bitcoin exchanges as Money Services Businesses (MSBs) subject to Bank Secrecy Act registration and reporting, while explicitly exempting individual miners and ordinary users from MSB obligations. This nuanced stance effectively told Americans, 'You may own and mine Bitcoin without fear of prosecution,' even as law enforcement was closing in on Silk Road operators. In the weeks following the ruling, Bitcoin's market price quadrupled from $50 to $200, reflecting newfound regulatory clarity"
